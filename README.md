## Getting Started

The following instructions will inform you on how to get this script running on your machine. For Windows users, I have included an .exe file to conveniently run the script if you do not have Python installed (this is found in the `dist` folder); for Mac/Linux users you will need to have Python installed- this can be downloaded from [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### 1. Installing dependencies 
You will need to install a few libraries for this script to work. This can be done through: 

 `pip install mutagen`

 `pip install requests`

 `pip install bs4`



# Usage
Run this program from the command-line via `py 2hu.py`.
